# Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses — Conjoint Analysis

▪️ Consumer analytics project applying conjoint analysis to evaluate smart glasses preferences  
▪️ Focused on feature trade-offs, pricing sensitivity, and market segmentation  

---

## ▸ Project Overview
This project applies **conjoint analysis** to examine consumer preferences for Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.

The primary objective is to understand **how consumers trade off between product features and price**, and how these insights can inform **product configuration, segmentation, and positioning decisions**.

---

## ▸ Business Objective
▪️ Identify key product attributes influencing consumer choice  
▪️ Evaluate trade-offs between technology features, usability, and price  
▪️ Assess consumer willingness-to-pay implications  
▪️ Support product and market strategy discussions

## ▸ Project Structure

### ▸ Methodology & Conjoint Design
▪️ Definition of the analytical problem and research objectives  
▪️ Justification for using conjoint analysis as the primary method  
▪️ Selection of product attributes and attribute levels reflecting realistic market scenarios  
▪️ Design of survey instruments and choice tasks  

### ▸ Data Analysis & Utility Estimation
▪️ Preparation and validation of survey response data  
▪️ Estimation of part-worth utilities for each attribute level  
▪️ Calculation of attribute importance scores  
▪️ Interpretation of utilities in relation to consumer trade-offs  

### ▸ Segmentation & Strategic Interpretation
▪️ Identification of consumer segments based on preference patterns  
▪️ Comparison of price sensitivity and feature priorities across segments  
▪️ Translation of analytical results into strategic insights  

---

## ▸ Data & Materials
▪️ Survey-based dataset capturing stated consumer choice behaviour  
▪️ Excel-based analysis files used for conjoint estimation and segmentation  

---

## ▸ Methodology
▪️ Conjoint analysis framework for trade-off evaluation  
▪️ Structured survey design with controlled product profiles  
▪️ Statistical estimation of part-worth utilities  
▪️ Descriptive and comparative analysis for segment interpretation  

---

## ▸ Key Findings
▪️ Clear distinction between must-have and nice-to-have smart glasses features  
▪️ Price sensitivity differed meaningfully across consumer segments  
▪️ Some advanced features delivered limited incremental utility relative to cost  
▪️ Preference patterns supported the feasibility of differentiated product offerings  

---

## ▸ Business Implications
▪️ Informs feature prioritisation and product configuration decisions  
▪️ Supports segmentation-driven product positioning  
▪️ Highlights pricing considerations for emerging consumer technology products  
▪️ Demonstrates how consumer analytics can reduce product-market uncertainty  

---

## ▸ Limitations & Assumptions
▪️ Results are based on stated preferences rather than observed purchase behaviour  
▪️ Findings depend on the selected attributes and levels included in the conjoint design  
▪️ Competitive dynamics and market evolution are not explicitly modelled  
▪️ Outputs should be used as decision support, not deterministic recommendations
